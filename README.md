# odin-landing-page

Creating a landing page according to The Odin Project's Project: Landing Page.

In this project I was tasked with creating HTML and CSS to match
the format given by The Odin Project. I created three main sections, from which
I created subsections.

In the future I would have more sections to contain divs, that way when setting the
width of the inside divs, it wouldn't alter the appearance of the outside section.
